# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## 1. What is this repository?

**claude-starter** is a **template repository** - a production-ready starting point for building your own Claude Code configuration.

**Purpose:**
- Drop into any project to give Claude domain expertise
- 40+ pre-built skills across AI, APIs, blockchain, backend, frontend
- TOON format support for 30-60% token savings on large datasets
- Clean template for building your own skills and commands
- Documentation pulled separately (not included in repo)

**This is NOT:**
- An application to run
- A library or framework
- Code to import

**This IS:**
- Configuration for Claude Code
- A collection of expertise (skills)
- Token optimization tools (TOON)
- A template you can learn from and extend

---

## 2. Complete Documentation

For complete documentation, see:

- **[`.claude/README.md`](.claude/README.md)** - Quick start, installation, usage guide
- **[`.claude/DIRECTORY.md`](.claude/DIRECTORY.md)** - Complete reference documentation
- **[`/docs/`](docs/)** - How to build skills, commands, hooks

## 4. The `.claude/` Directory

### What's in it

**40 Skills** - Auto-invoked knowledge domains organized into 10 categories:
- **anthropic/** - AI & Claude Code (7 skills)
- **aptos/** - Blockchain & Shelby Protocol (17 skills)
- **decibel/** - On-chain trading (1 skill)
- **plaid/** - Banking API (5 skills)
- **shopify/** - E-commerce platform (1 skill)
- **stripe/** - Payments (1 skill)

- **whop/** - Digital products platform (1 skill)
- **expo/** - React Native (4 skills)
- **ios/** - iOS development (1 skill)
- **toon-formatter/** - Token optimization (1 skill)

**Documentation** - Pull separately using `docpull`:
- Stripe: 3,253 files
- Supabase: 2,616 files
- Expo: 810 files
- Plaid: 659 files
- Whop: 212 files
- Claude Code: 201 files

**7 Commands** - Slash commands (5 TOON format + 2 skill marketplace):
- `/analyze-tokens` - Compare JSON vs TOON savings
- `/convert-to-toon` - Full conversion workflow
- `/toon-decode` - TOON → JSON
- `/toon-encode` - JSON → TOON
- `/toon-validate` - Format validation
- `/discover-skills` - Browse SkillsMP marketplace

## 5. How Skills Work

Skills **auto-activate** based on conversation context:

| Keyword | Skill | Documentation |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Stripe API, payments | Stripe | 3,253 docs |
| Whop, memberships | Whop | 212 docs |
| Supabase, PostgreSQL | Supabase | 2,616 docs |
| Aptos, Move language | Aptos | 150+ docs |
| Expo, React Native | Expo | 810 docs |
| Plaid, banking | Plaid | 659 docs |
| Shopify, e-commerce | Shopify | 25 docs |
| TOON, token optimization | TOON Formatter | Tools + guide |

**Skills are hierarchically organized:**
- Shelby Protocol is nested under Aptos (decentralized blob storage on Aptos blockchain)
- Decibel is also Aptos-based but separate as a trading platform
- Plaid has 4 sub-skills (Auth, Transactions, Identity, Accounts)
- Expo has 3 sub-skills (EAS Build, EAS Update, Expo Router)

---

## 6. TOON Format

**What is it?**
TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) reduces token consumption by **30-60%** for tabular data.

**When to use:**
- Arrays with 5+ items
- Objects with 60%+ field uniformity
- API responses, logs, metrics, benchmarks

**Example:**
```javascript
// JSON: ~120 tokens
[
  {"method": "GET", "path": "/api/users", "auth": "required"},
  {"method": "POST", "path": "/api/users", "auth": "required"}
]

// TOON: ~70 tokens (40% savings)
[2]{method,path,auth}:
  GET,/api/users,required
  POST,/api/users,required
```

**Complete specification:** `.claude/utils/toon/toon-guide.md`

---

## 7. Quick Start

### Use skills automatically

Skills activate when relevant keywords are mentioned:

```
User: "How do I create a Stripe subscription?"
Stripe skill activates with 3,253 docs

User: "Build a Whop membership system"
Whop skill activates with 212 docs

User: "This JSON is too big"
TOON formatter activates with optimization tools
```

### Pull documentation (optional)

```bash
# Install docpull
brew install pipx
pipx install docpull

# Pull docs for specific skills
docpull https://docs.stripe.com -o .claude/skills/stripe/docs
docpull https://supabase.com/docs -o .claude/skills/supabase/docs
```

### Use commands

```bash
/convert-to-toon data.json
/analyze-tokens api-response.json
/discover-skills
```

### Install more skills

```bash
/discover-skills          # Browse 13,000+ skills
/install-skill <url>      # Install from GitHub
```

### Build your own

```bash
# Add skills to .claude/skills/
# Create commands in .claude/commands/
# See /docs/creating-components.md for templates
```

## 9. Working with this Repository

### As a template

Users can:
1. **Use directly** - Clone and use as-is
2. **Copy to project** - `cp -r .claude/ /my-project/`
3. **Pick what they need** - Copy specific skills/commands
4. **Learn from it** - See how skills/commands are structured
5. **Extend it** - Add their own skills/commands

### As a learning resource

The structure demonstrates:
- How to organize skills hierarchically
- How to embed documentation in skills
- How to create slash commands
- How to build automation hooks
- How to integrate external tools (TOON)
- How to connect to marketplaces (SkillsMP)

### When helping users

**Avoid:**
- Creating documentation files (already comprehensive)
- Adding files unless explicitly requested
- Over-engineering solutions
- Proposing changes to code you haven't read

**Do:**
- Read existing files before suggesting modifications
- Use existing skills when they match user needs
- Suggest TOON format for large data files
- Point to `/docs` for how-to guides
- Reference `.claude/DIRECTORY.md` for structure

---

## 10. Important Notes
